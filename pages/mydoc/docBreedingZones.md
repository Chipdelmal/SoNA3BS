summary: "Breeding zones represent the places where mosquitoes lay eggs in the environment. These are also the sites in which aquatic stages of the mosquito life-cycle occur."

## General Behaviour
These objects are static for now. The carrying capacity is calculated as a whole counting all the breeding sites in the environment for now (see <a href="http://chipdelmal.github.io/SoNA3BS/licPublications.html">thesis document</a> for more details). This was mainly for computational cost reasons but could be extended in the future (possible extensions include: independent carrying capacity, water level, surface area, depth, etcetera).
